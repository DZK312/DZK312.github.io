    <h1>Where's your mind at?</h1>
    <p>Just something interesting about how I choose to carry my life: Often times, children look up at adults, 
        and for whatever the reason, they want to grow up and <strong>become adults faster</strong>,<br>yet there are also adults who look back on their childhoods
        and wish that they could've <strong>held onto that time of their life for longer</strong>. So what does that say about a person 
        who<br>recognizes that conundrum early on in life and decides to hold on to their childhood for as long as they reasonably can,
        or even those who choose (or are forced to as a result<br>of some situation) to grow up early, and become an adult - in mind - 
        before ever really getting to live as a kid?<br>It's one of those pesky <strong>'you only realize something's value when it's gone'</strong> type of scenarios.</p>
